But that\u2019s not the only reason to make the trip to Willets Point: Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, an expansive mass of greenery a stone\u2019s throw from where you watch the Mets, offers more space than you could ever explore in one day. Depending on whom you ask, it\u2019s the second-largest park in the city (1,255 acres), home to U.S. Open\u2013caliber tennis at Arthur Ashe Stadium, flowers, history and art at the Queens Botanical Gardens, Museum and Theatre, par-3 golf courses, lakes, BBQ pits, countless soccer fields and more than enough lounge-worthy places to spend an afternoon in the sun. Aside from being the perfect venue for your weekend pursuits, it\u2019s worth noting that the park hosted two World\u2019s Fairs (1939 and 1964), and iconic reminders of the latter still stand in the park.\n\nExplore the world in Queens\nThe futuristic-looking Unisphere structure was created for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair to showcase advances in technology, computers and the dawn of the Space Age. It\u2019s also one of the city\u2019s most memorable and recognizable landmarks (and not just because it made a cameo in Men in Black): At 140 feet, it\u2019s the largest replica of Earth on Earth, made of stainless steel and orbited by three rings representing the first man in space, the first American to orbit earth and the first communications satellite. In the summer, you can take a refreshing dip in the surrounding fountains; at night, the entire thing is bathed in light, turning it into a glowing orb that\u2019s impossible to miss.\n\nGet out your green thumb\nOriginally created for the 1939 World\u2019s Fair as a five-acre showcase of old-fashioned gardens, the Queens Botanical Garden relocated and grew\u00a0to 39 acres, and it\u2019s now home to some of the most gorgeous flowers, herbs and pollinators in the city. And even though it is located on top of an old ash landfill, the garden adheres to sustainable practices wherever possible: The visitor\u2019s building was the first to be LEED certified by the U.S. Green Building Council, and farm and composting events are held there regularly. Two highlights: the herb garden, which groups herbs by uses like healing and cooking, and the fragrance walk, where you can discover plants that make your fingers smell like gum, soap...or even pizza.\n\nMake time for the museum\nOne of the coolest things at the Queens Museum within the park is the Panorama of the City of New York, a 9,335-square-foot, hand-painted mini version of the city made of wood, plastic and paper that took three years to create initially: It features all 895,000 buildings built before 1992, as well as bridges, parks and famous landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building. Other long-term exhibits include the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass and artifacts from both World\u2019s Fairs. If you\u2019re planning your visit instead of showing up spontaneously, be sure to check the events calendar: The museum also features rotating modern art exhibits including movies, photo, live music and poetry performances.\n\nOur New York editorial team is constantly updating and reviewing the best attractions, activities and venues across the city, so that you're always in the know, with the best of NYC. at your fingertips.
